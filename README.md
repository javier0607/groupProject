# Whether or Not


Are you tired of not knowing where to go or what to do today? Then, after finally deciding to go and the weather is just horrible for the plan you made. Weather or Not is a new project that solves these issues by being able to search all around your area for various things to do. Whether it is fishing, bowling alleys, parasailing and so much more. As well as, not having to go through the hassle of figuring out the weather forecast for today since the website tells you the air pressure, the rain chance, wind speeds, and even what the temperature actually feels like. We decided to make this project since it sucks to make plans and not know of local activities near you due to google only showing the same 5 big chain places and then having to do another google search on the weather. We wanted it to be all in the same spot to make it more convenient to the user.

The websites begins with it first asking you for your location in order for the places API to be able to know your longitute and latitude. Then, you will search anything you want to do and then the api will search from a 5000 meters and gives you 20 results, giving you plenty of options to choose from. Then, after getting those results you can hover over the markers and see some names of places nearby on what you have provided if they are near you. Afterwards, or even before this you can look at the weather of your current location in order to see what plans you should make depending on the weather. Hence the name Whether or Not.
